# Options pricing
The aim of this project is to price many types of option under different models. 

In the main file, you can find how we evaluate European and American options under Binomial model.

In the Portfolio metrics file, you can file the evaluation of European and Binary options under the BS formula.
You will also be able to find the pricing of an Asian option which is done under monte carlo simulation (have to be completed).
We also have build a portfolio in which you can add options and observe its greeks (only availible for Binary and European so far).
