# Options pricing
The aim of this project is to price many types of option under different models. 

# main.py: Binomial Models
In the main.py, you can find how we evaluate European and American options under Binomial model.

# Portfolio metrics.py: Black and Scholes and Monte Carlo Simulation
In the Portfolio metrics.py, you can file the evaluation of European and Binary options under the BS formula.
You will also be able to find the pricing of Asian and different type of Barrier options which are done under monte carlo simulation (have to be completed).
I also have construct a function which allow to build a portfolio of options and to observe the greeks of the portfolio(only availible for Binary and European so far).
